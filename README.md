# Loan-Repayment-Prediction-Project
This project uses DNNs to predict whether a loan will be repayed or defaulted on. The data set includes many different features regarding loan details, credit history, borrower information and  more.  The aim is to use machine learning algorithms to build a robust model that financial institutions could apply for predicting loan default risk.
